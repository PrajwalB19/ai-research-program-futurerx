# Pancreatic Cancer Detection

This project aims to detect pancreatic cancer using urinary biomarkers and various machine learning models. The dataset used is publicly available on Kaggle.

## Dataset
- [Urinary Biomarkers for Pancreatic Cancer (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnjdavisiv/urinary-biomarkers-for-pancreatic-cancer/data)

## Machine Learning Models Used
The following models were implemented and evaluated:

1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
3. **Decision Tree**
4. **Random Forest**
5. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
6. **Naive Bayes**
7. **XGBoost** (including hyperparameter tuning with RandomizedSearchCV)

## Workflow Overview
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis
- Feature selection and scaling
- Model training and evaluation
- Hyperparameter tuning (for XGBoost)

## Requirements
See `requirements.txt` for all dependencies.

## Usage
Open and run the notebook `pacreatic_cancer.ipynb` to reproduce the analysis and results.

## License
